# Challenge 10 Crypto Clustering

This is a Jupyter notebook that clusters cryptocurrencies by their performance in different time periods. Iâ€™ll combine my financial Python programming skills with the new unsupervised learning skills that I acquired in this module.


The CSV file contains price change data of cryptocurrencies in different periods.

The steps for this challenge are broken out into the following sections:

* Import the Data
* Prepare the Data
* Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Data
* Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Data
* Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
* Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data
* Cluster the Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data
* Visualize and Compare the Results
